<h1>CSV File Analyzer Using Python and Python modules(eg. matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, numpy)</h1>

In this Repository,
There is a file named "generate_csv.py" -- This program automatically generates a csv file with given data pattern. The csv file is also included with the folder.<br>
Changing parameters of this you can generate your choice of csv file or you can use a external file.<br>
I have also used a geoJson File of the world to create a advanced real-world heatmap.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Steps:<br>
1: Creating the project Folder.<br>
2: Building generate_csv.py file and generating the csv file.<br>
3: Analyzing the file using pandas and noting down data patterns. <br>
4: Plotting different graphs/plots to present the resultant plots.
